<p>This is a security release! Git LFS (which is enabled by default in Git for Windows) fixes CVE-2025-26625 (Severity rated High, 8.6 / 10) in v3.7.1. Please only clone or pull from repositories you trust until you upgraded.

Due to persistent maintenance challenges and the community's limited engagement and usage, git svn support in Git for Windows will be dropped from the next major Git for Windows release.

Note that git flow is no longer shipped with Git for Windows, after a version had been distributed that had been languishing for years. Even the original, years-stale Git Flow project has been archived.
